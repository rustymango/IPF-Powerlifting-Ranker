# Powerlifting-Website

This website is a passion project intended to help powerlifters track the progress
of their powerlifting careers. Users are able to determine the ranking of their individual
lifts relative to IPF registered powerlifters across the globe who are in the same lifting
class by entering their lifting stats. Their lifts are compared against data scraped from IPF
records and the percentage of lifters with lower lifts than the user are reported.

The intent is to add an account feature to allow users to save their ranks associated
with dates and display these records in a graph.
